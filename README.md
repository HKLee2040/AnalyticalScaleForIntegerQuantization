# ACIQ: ANALYTICAL CLIPPING FOR INTEGER QUANTIZATION OF NEURAL NETWORKS
This is complete example for applying Laplace and Gaussian clipping on activations of CNN.

## Dependencies

- [pytorch](<http://www.pytorch.org>)
- [torchvision](<https://github.com/pytorch/vision>) to load the datasets, perform image transforms
- [pandas](<http://pandas.pydata.org/>) for logging to csv
- [bokeh](<http://bokeh.pydata.org>) for training visualization

## Data
- To run this code you need validation set from ILSVRC2012 data
- Configure your dataset path by providing --data "PATH_TO_ILSVRC" or copy ILSVRC dir to ~/datasets/ILSVRC2012.
- To get the ILSVRC2012 data, you should register on their site for access: <http://www.image-net.org/>

## Building cuda kernels for GEMMLOWP
To improve performance GEMMLOWP quantization was implemented in cuda and requires to compile kernels.
